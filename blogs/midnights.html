                        <p>
                            On October 21st, 2022, Taylor Swift dropped her highly-anticipated 10th studio album. After
                            a near radio-silence year with very few contents, I was really excited for this album.
                            And frankly, this album did not disappoint. Overall this album ensembles the concept of "13
                            Sleepless Nights,"
                            and each song has a certain sound that corresponds to her "eras." That said, I've been
                            putting the album on repeat for months
                            and I haven't been able to rank the tracks at all... until now.<br><br>

                        This song is not the best of Taylor Swift, but it's still better than 70% of the song nowadays.
                        I think this track is another love letter to her current boyfriend Joe Alwyn. While it has some
                        lyrical highlights, as well as the viral meme-ified lyrics <em>"Tom pdom pdem alleyways"
                        (Stumble down pretend alleyways)</em>,
                        it falls short when compared to other songs such as Lover, Delicate, or even some other tracks
                        on this album.

                        You might think that I just hate happy songs (maybe I am). But <em>Sweet Nothing</em>, yet
                        another track dedicated
                        to her boyfriend (who once again appeared in songwriting credits as William Bowery, served as
                        the quiet, intimate ballad
                        of the album. In this track, Taylor described the security and privacy she found in her
                        relationship. It's not a bad song, but
                        the majority of the album outshines this track.

                        As Swift's shortest song in her catalog, <em>Glitch</em> is a track that received mixed reviews
                        on the album.
                        On first listen, the arrangement of the track could give people whiplash. While it did grow on
                        me after a few listens, it has
                        aged badly for me. Its lyrics are not remarkable (though still better than 90% of the pop
                        songs), and the production sees Taylor Swift
                        experimenting in a new subgenre (that may have been a miss).

                        RIP to <em>"I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this."</em> - (Paper Rings,
                        2019). In the closing track of <em>Midnights</em>,
                        Swift confesses that nothing about their relationship was accidental. She is the mastermind
                        behind all of it. The song then took an unexpected plot
                        twist at the end - <em>"Saw a wide smirk on your face, you knew the entire time. You knew that
                        I'm a mastermind."</em>

                        This little ranking has more lines than Lana Del Rey's entire verse on this song. I have to
                        complain about this one because their voice blends
                        beautifully, yet in another Swift fashion, Lana Del Rey got the backing vocals treatment on <em>Snow
                        on the Beach</em>. And now I'm just left wondering
                        about what would've, could've, should've been. (Shout out to Dylan O'Brien for the drums
                        though.)

                        This song gives me mixed feelings. I think this is a track that would've been amazing on her
                        folk projects such as evermore, embracing the heavy infidelity theme of the album... But as
                        a bonus track on the pop record - it just doesn't hit as much as it would've. There are tracks
                        that
                        are a lot stronger than <em>High Infidelity</em>.

                        Taylor Swift unleashes her "reputation" persona on this track and gives us a glimpse of what's
                        to come
                        in the <em>Reputation (Taylor's Version)</em> vault tracks. This track sounds like a twin sister
                        to her 2017 hit
                        <em>Look What You Made Me Do</em>, but more violent and vengeful. Its minimal production is
                        well-executed, and
                        the lyrics hit her adversary in every spot that hurts.

                        You think Jake Gyllenhaal had it bad during <em>Red (Taylor's Version)</em>? Wait until you hear
                        this track.
                        Fans have been speculating that this song is about her infamous ex John Mayer. The Speak
                        Now production of this track further cemented Swiftie's theory. In my opinion this is a much

                        gut-wrenching song than "All Too Well", and the lyrics were genius. Even though the titled was
                        "Would've,
                        Could've, Should've", she did not sing "should've" at all during the chorus - becaus she sang
                        them all
                        in the <em>Speak Now</em> fan favorite "Dear John."

                        Now. This song truly feels like a throwback to her sleepless nights. This is her "glitter gel
                        pen" at its prime.
                        The lyrics are fun yet sophisticated (unlike a certain lead single on her 7th studio album...)
                        This song gives off
                        <em>1989</em> vibes and it feels like a more confident version of the <em>folklore</em> track
                        "mirrorball". <em>"Best believe I'm still bejeweled, when I walk in a room, I can still make the
                        whole place shimmer."</em> Yes you absolutely can!

                        This song is officially the saddest song she has ever written. "Bigger Than The Whole Sky" talks
                        about grief and losing something very precious to you. The greatest thing about her songwriting
                        is
                        that even though everyone had a different story, they all relate to this song and use it as a
                        way to express their feelings. The best (and most heart-breaking) line happens in the second
                        verse,
                        <em>"Did some bird flap its wing over in Asia? Did some force take you because I didn't
                            pray?"</em>

                        "Dear Reader" is the most underrated track on the album. It wasn't catchy at first listen, but
                        it ages like a fine wine with every listen. It is by far her best closing track, and the lyrics
                        are top tier. <em>"Never take advice from someone who's falling apart."</em> combined with the
                        auto-tune
                        to insinuate that she hides away her broken self. I adore this song.

                        "Labyrinth" is a very interesting song. It's not as catchy as the other tracks, but it's a
                        highlight of the album nonetheless. One thing that I admire about this track is the way Swift
                        tweaks the same line to represent feelings of falling in love - <em>"Uh oh, I'm falling in
                        love."</em> shows the surprise and the realization; <em>"Oh no, I'm falling in love again."</em>
                        illustrates the fear to falling in love; and finally, <em>"Oh, I'm falling in love."</em> feels
                        like acceptance and knowing that it'll be different this time around.

                        Feels familiar? Taylor Swift had already hinted the track title during her NYU
                        commencement speech in May. This is not the saddest track 5 in Taylor's discography. Yet it is
                        her most prolific track 5 ever. In "You're on Your Own, Kid", Taylor talks about her past,
                        hardships, and a hopeful attitude towards the future. The best thing about this song is the way
                        she used the same phrase, yet the meaning of it is the polar opposite. Have a listen, and you'll
                        understand what I meant.

                        feel like everybody is a sexy baby, and I'm a monster on the hill."</em> to the infamous "fat"
                        scene in the music video (it is totally valid and it isn't fatphobic, by the way.) It's a
                        feel-good song sonically and a comforting song lyrically - who doesn't love a combo like this?

                        Sorry to all the "Karma the scrapped album" truthers, it doesn't exist. But "Karma the ultimate
                        pop anthem" does exist, and I think you'd be happy enough with this one. This song take the word
                        "Karma" for what it is - pop culture nowadays tend to associate karma with bad consequences, but
                        in Swift's perspective it is simply a reflection of your own doing. She keeps the side of her
                        street clean, therefore, karma is a cat purring in her lap because it loves her. (Did you
                        realize who "Spider Boy" is about? Hint: The initials... Yeah, she's clever)

                        Maroon being on Top 5 is pretty self-explanatory. It is, sonically and lyrically, an older, more
                        mature sister of "Red". One thing about this track is the usage of all the "reds" in the chorus.
                        It's an amazing experience first time listening to the song with the lyrics, I can see it
                        becoming one of the underrated deep-cuts on this album.

                        "Question...?" may not be everyone's favorite, but if it's yours, you're someone with an amazing
                        music taste. Stuck between the fan favorite "Midnight Rain" and the hot topic "Vigilante Shit",
                        this song often gets overlooked. However, it is a good song - <em>"Good girl, sad boy, big city,
                        wrong choices"</em> is one of her most descriptive (and effective) lyric to date. The chorus
                        sounds like an intervention, with Taylor asking the "question" to an unknown recipient. The
                        "...?" in the title is also clever, because I feel like those "questions" aren't really
                        questions, instead it's Swift trying to get her closure.

                        her past trauma and insecurity getting in the way of an amazing relationship. The abundance of
                        World War I imagery and the metaphors made this song the best she's ever written. It's also rare
                        to see her take responsibility in a song about relationships. The bridge still gives me chill to
                        this day - <em>"It turned into something bigger, somewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been
                        betrayed."</em> Referencing the opening track "Lavender Haze"... She's truly the mastermind.

                        "Midnight Rain" captures the essence of the album - sleepless nights, past that haunts oneself,
                        lie awake in the regret and turmoil. The pitched-down vocal effect also gives the song a nice
                        touch - almost as if you're dreaming. It has quickly become a fan favorite upon release, and now
                        the fans are wondering if she'll ever make this a single - guess we'll just have to wait and
                        see.

                        As the opening track on the album, "Lavender Haze" did an amazing job to intrigue the listeners
                        and set the tone for the album.
                        With a catchy beat (Thanks to the new producers) and the dreamy falsetto in the chorus, this
                        song would be an amazing single, and it's so far the song with the most replay value on the
                        album. I can't wait to see her venture into this sound and make an album out of it.
